"""
This module provides a set of platform integration tests for the retail store network, covering the Cisco DNA, Solarwinds, and DDI platforms. These tests are designed to evaluate the integration and interoperability of various network components, helping to ensure that the network functions optimally and that critical business operations are not impacted by infrastructure issues.

The platform integration tests provided by this module cover a range of scenarios and conditions, including tests for application compatibility, network protocol compatibility, and data transfer integrity. These tests can be run on-demand or integrated into automated testing frameworks to provide ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the retail store network.

By utilizing these platform integration tests, network administrators can proactively identify and address potential issues before they impact critical business operations. This module serves as a valuable resource for improving the overall reliability and performance of the retail store network.
