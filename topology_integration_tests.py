"""
This module provides a set of physical topology tests for the retail store network. These tests are designed to evaluate the physical connectivity and layout of network components, helping to ensure that the network is functioning optimally and that critical business operations are not impacted by infrastructure issues.

The physical topology tests provided by this module cover a range of scenarios and conditions, including tests for cabling continuity, power supply redundancy, and physical device placement. These tests can be run on-demand or integrated into automated testing frameworks to provide ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the retail store network.

By utilizing these physical topology tests, network administrators can proactively identify and address potential issues before they impact critical business operations. This module serves as a valuable resource for improving the overall reliability and performance of the retail store network.
